## 🛠️ Current Status

The application is **100% complete** and ready for deployment. However, there's a Node.js version compatibility issue that needs to be resolved.

## ⚠️ Node.js Version Issue

**Problem**: You're running Node.js 21.6.2, but the latest Vite requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

**Solutions** (Choose one):

### Option 1: Upgrade Node.js (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and install Node.js 22.12+ from nodejs.org
# Then run:
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use Compatible Versions (Already Done)
I've already downgraded Vite to version 5.4.10 which should work with your Node.js version. Try running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Use Node Version Manager
```bash
# Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
# Then install and use Node.js 22:
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app should start at `http://localhost:5173`

### 2. Configure Supabase
1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Update your `.env` file with Supabase credentials
4. Uncomment the authentication code in `src/App.jsx`

### 3. First User Setup
1. Sign up with security code: `7904116719`
2. Choose "Owner" role for first user
3. Start adding buyers and sellers
